I am a second-year PhD Candidate in Political Science at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS)](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) at the University of Mannheim and a research associate at the [Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en). My substantial research focuses on **coalition politics** and **electoral behavior**, where I am especially interested in pre-electoral coalition politics and how it affects electoral behavior. I am also interested in **quantitative and computational methods**, particularly in agent-based models which I utilize, e.g., in order to study opinion dynamics.
